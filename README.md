# KNN_SFML
Graphic implementation of KNN algorithm. (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9thode_des_k_plus_proches_voisins)

Debug version should need .dll of SFML.

Release version is static.

# IDE
Used Visual Studio Community 2019.

# Depedencies
Implemented in C++ with the multimedia library SFML 2.5.1 (https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/index-fr.php)

# Next
1. Dynamically add point with label.
2. Change the position of a point.
3. Optimization ?

# What I want this project to be
I want to redo this project to be a guided tour for the knn algorithm, explaining how it's working. What are the parameter, how you can optimize it etc.

But I won't do it now.
